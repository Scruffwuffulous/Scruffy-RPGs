OH MY GOD WHYYYYYY

Some notes I must transfer from paper, which all seem to be setting based?:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item AI never succeeded :/ Besides: it's cheaper to rip the consciousness of debtors and old creatives...
    \item Body modification has become cheap \& stylish. Good body modification is just stylish...
    \item Cyberspace is on its third great instance \& is almost indistinguishable from a dark mirror of reality. Those who control it wield great powers
    \item Everyone can interface with almost anything or anyone...
    \item Who owns you?
\end{enumerate}

Additionally (more mechanically focussed) I wrote:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One of the Prime Sets is "Memories (of People?)"
\end{itemize}

Other additional stuff:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No hack skill, no persuade skill
\end{itemize}
