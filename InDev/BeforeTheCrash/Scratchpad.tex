OH MY GOD WHYYYYYY

Some notes I must transfer from paper, which all seem to be setting based?:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item AI never succeeded :/ Besides: it's cheaper to rip the consciousness of debtors and old creatives...
    \item Body modification has become cheap \& stylish. Good body modification is just stylish...
    \item Cyberspace is on its third great instance \& is almost indistinguishable from a dark mirror of reality. Those who control it wield great powers
    \item Everyone can interface with almost anything or anyone...
    \item Who owns you?
\end{enumerate}

Additionally (more mechanically focussed) I wrote:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One of the Prime Sets is "Memories (of People?)"
\end{itemize}

Other additional stuff:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No hack skill, no persuade skill
    \item GM tip: You should never have to roll to find clues, only information
    \item In my experience, a mystery plot is best planned by coming up with the antagonist's full plan and running that at the same time as the investigation. The bad guys should be moving actively while the PCs are investigating them.
\end{itemize}


Reworking the roles to be more basic, then allowing the player to add their own descriptor speciality afterwards. OR you get to pick standard array for your roles and then can add specialities to them to step up the relevant die (Will require standard array to be balanced low)

We call the following the or \textbf{F.I.R.S.T} system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fighter (Grappler/Scrapper/Sniper)
    \item Investigator (Detective/Journalist/Sheriff)
    \item Rebel (Artist/Criminal/Firebrand)
    \item Street Punk (Corpo Trash/Gang Member/Grew Up Here)
    \item Technomancer (Board Masher/Chrome Freak/Net Runner)
\end{itemize}
