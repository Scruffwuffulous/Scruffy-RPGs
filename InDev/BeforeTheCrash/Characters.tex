\section{Characters and how to make them}

\subsection{Roles}

Roles describe how well your character fits into a certain role; how well they act at wearing the particular hats that are involved in their day-to-day.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigator\index{Investigator}
    \begin{enumerate}

        \item Journalist\index{Journalist}: With a open ear and an eye for sources, the journalists know how to get to the heart of a scoop for better or worse
        \item Sheriff\index{Sheriff}: You are the kind of person to knock down every door to get your man. Your jurisdiction has no boundaries, and neither do your methods.
        \item Secret Fourth Thing!
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Some kind of how you get around and how you live your day-to-day. This should be your bread and butter

        \item Therapist\index{Therapist}: Over-analysis of every thought has led you to what you think is understanding of how you and everyone you meet works.
        \item Officer\index{Officer}: A strict routine and set of habits prevent you from being too close to your thoughts and problems. They can't hurt you as long as you follow the rules, right?
        \item Cynic\index{Cynic}: You've given in to the negative thoughts of life, your friends, and the world at large. At least you don't have to fight it any more.
