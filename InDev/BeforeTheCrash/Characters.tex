\subsection{What makes up a character?}

In this chapter, we shall go over the character \textbf{stats} and what they represent, both in terms of a character's physical and mental attributes, and their personality, traits, and other characteristics. If you have played a TTRPG before, like \textbf{Dungeons \& Dragons}, some of these will be somewhat familiar to you. Others take more inspiration from less crunchy games, especially those that are \textbf{Powered by the Apocalypse}. If this seems like nonsense to you, don't Worry! Hopefully all will be explained in this chapter...

\subsubsection{The F.I.R.S.T. system}

Roles describe how well your character fits into a certain role; how well they act at wearing the particular hats that are involved in their day-to-day.

Roles are split into different \textbf{Role Classes}\index{Role Classes}. These are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fighter\index{Fighter}
    \item Investigator\index{Investigator}
    \item Rebel\index{Rebel}
    \item Street Punk\index{Street Punk}
    \item Technomancer\index{Technomancer}
\end{itemize}
