# Scruffy-RPGs

This is the repo for TTRPGs made by and currently in development by Scruffwuffulous and those cursed with working with them. If you happen across these, welcome!

Hopefully, you have a local way of compiling .tex files so you can have a proper look at the WIP games, otherwise, when a game has reached a point we are happy with, a pdf should arrive in the releases folder!

Otherwise, I should probably put a quick summary of the games found in this repo:

* Before The Crash: A cyberpunk adventure based on the Cortex Prime toolkit
